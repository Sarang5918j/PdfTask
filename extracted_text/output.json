    "Abstract": "As a prominent early instance of the IoT in the smart grid, the advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) provides real-time information from smart meters to both grid operators and customers, exploiting the full potential of demand response. However, the newly-collected information without security protection can be maliciously altered and result in huge loss. In this paper, we propose an energy theft detection scheme with energy privacy preservation in the smart grid. Specially, we use combined convolutional neural networks (CNN) to detect abnormal behavior of the metering data from a long-period pattern observation. In addition, we employ Paillier algorithm to protect the energy privacy. In other words, the users\u2019 energy data are securely protected in the transmission and the data disclosure is minimized. Our security analysis demonstrates that in our scheme data privacy and authentication are both achieved. Experimental results illustrate that our modified CNN model can effectively detect abnormal behaviors at an accuracy up to 92.67%."

    "Abstract": "As one of the key components of the smart grid, advanced metering infrastructure brings many potential advantages such as load management and demand response. However, computerizing the metering system also introduces numerous new vectors for energy theft. In this paper, we present a novel consumption pattern-based energy theft detector, which leverages the predictability property of customers' normal and malicious consumption patterns. Using distribution transformer meters, areas with a high probability of energy theft are short listed, and by monitoring abnormalities in consumption patterns, suspicious customers are identified. Application of appropriate classification and clustering techniques, as well as concurrent use of transformer meters and anomaly detectors, make the algorithm robust against nonmalicious changes in usage pattern, and provide a high and adjustable performance with a low-sampling rate. Therefore, the proposed method does not invade customers' privacy. Extensive experiments on a real dataset of 5000 customers show a high performance for the proposed method."

    "Abstract": "In advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) networks, smart meters installed at the consumer side should report fine-grained power consumption readings (every few minutes) to the system operator for billing, real-time load monitoring, and energy management. On the other hand, AMI networks are vulnerable to cyber-attacks where malicious consumers report false (low) electricity consumption to reduce their bills in an illegal way. Therefore, it is imperative to develop schemes to accurately identify the consumers that steal electricity by reporting false electricity usage. Most of the existing schemes rely on machine learning for electricity theft detection using the consumers\u2019 fine-grained power consumption meter readings. However, this fine-grained data that is used for electricity theft decetion, load monitoring, and billing can also be misused to infer sensitive information regarding the consumers such as whether they are on travel, the appliances they use, etc. In this paper, we propose an efficient and privacy-preserving electricity theft detection scheme for AMI network and we refer to it as PPETD. Our scheme allows system operators to identify the electricity thefts, monitor the loads, and compute electricity bills efficiently using masked fine-grained meter readings without violating the consumers\u2019 privacy. PPETD uses secret sharing to allow the consumers to send masked readings to the system operator such that these readings can be aggregated for the purpose of monitoring and billing. In addition, secure two-party protocols using arithmetic and binary circuits are executed by the system operator and each consumer to evaluate a generalized convolutionalneural network model on the reported masked fine-grained power consumption readings for the purpose of electricity theft detection. An extensive analysis on real datasets is performed to evaluate the security and the performance of PPETD. Our results confirm that our scheme is accurate in detecting fraudulent consumers with privacy preservation and acceptable communication and computation overhead."

    "Abstract": "Energy theft is a notorious problem in electric power systems, which causes great economic losses and threatens the reliability of the power grid. Recently, the Smart Grid has been proposed as the next-generation power system to modernize the current grid and improve its efficiency, sustainability, and security. Key technologies of the Smart Grid include smart meters, which allow system operators to collect real-time power consumption data from users, and microgrids, which allow users to own and control renewable resources. However, the Smart Grid is vulnerable to cyber attacks, thus making stealing energy much easier in it. Most existing energy theft detection schemes require the collection of real-time power consumption data from users, i.e., users' load profiles, which violates their privacy. In this paper, we first propose a centralized energy theft detection algorithm utilizing the Kalman filter, called SEK. It can efficiently identify the energy thieves but cannot protect users' privacy. Then, based on SEK, we develop a privacy-preserving energy theft detection algorithm called PPBE, which privately finds the energy thieves by decomposing the Kalman filter into two parallel and loosely coupled filters. Finally, we conduct thorough privacy analysis and extensive simulations to validate our proposed algorithms."

    "Abstract": "Modern smart grids rely on advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) networks for monitoring and billing pur- poses. However, such an approach suffers from electricity theft cyberattacks. Different from the existing research that utilizes shallow, static, and customer-specific-based electricity theft de- tectors, this paper proposes a generalized deep recurrent neural network (RNN)-based electricity theft detector that can effectively thwart these cyberattacks. The proposed model exploits the time series nature of the customers' electricity consumption to implement a gated recurrent unit (GRU)-RNN, hence, improving the detection performance. In addition, the proposed RNN-based detector adopts a random search analysis in its learning stage to appropriately fine-tune its hyper-parameters. Extensive test studies are carried out to investigate the detector's performance using publicly available real data of 107,200 energy consumption days from 200 customers. Simulation results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed detector compared with state-of-the-art electricity theft detectors."

    "Abstract": "In the U.S., energy theft causes about six billion dollar losses to utility companies (UCs) every year. With the smart grid being proposed to modernize current power grids, energy theft may become an even more serious problem since the \"smart meters\" used in smart grids are vulnerable to more types of attacks compared to traditional mechanical meters. Therefore, it is important to develop efficient and reliable methods to identify illegal users who are committing energy theft. Although some schemes have been proposed for the UCs to detect energy theft in power grids, they all require users to send their private information, e.g., load profiles or meter readings at certain times, to the UCs, which invades users' privacy and raises serious concerns about privacy, safety, etc. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to investigate the energy theft detection problem considering users' privacy issues. Specifically, in this paper, utilizing peer-to-peer (P2P) computing, we propose three distributed algorithms to solve a linear system of equations (LSE) for users' \"honesty coefficients\". Extensive simulations are carried out and the results show that the proposed algorithms can efficiently and successfully identify the fraudulent users in the system."
