1,Energy Theft Detection With Energy Privacy Preservation in the Smart Grid,https://www.researchgate.net/publication/331578806_Energy_Theft_Detection_With_Energy_Privacy_Preservation_in_the_Smart_Grid?_sg=UQE62f46g0iOKeru0NOfi31NWqx_a_1YuGl7UVazN2MNzLJEbt6nEPOlvFHMlbkjYv7WL81hRXNUr-g,"As a prominent early instance of the IoT in the smart grid, the advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) provides real-time information from smart meters to both grid operators and customers, exploiting the full potential of demand response. However, the newly-collected information without security protection can be maliciously altered and result in huge loss. In this paper, we propose an energy theft detection scheme with energy privacy preservation in the smart grid. Specially, we use combined convolutional neural networks (CNN) to detect abnormal behavior of the metering data from a long-period pattern observation. In addition, we employ Paillier algorithm to protect the energy privacy. In other words, the users’ energy data are securely protected in the transmission and the data disclosure is minimized. Our security analysis demonstrates that in our scheme data privacy and authentication are both achieved. Experimental results illustrate that our modified CNN model can effectively detect abnormal behaviors at an accuracy up to 92.67%."
2,Electricity Theft Detection in AMI Using Customers Consumption Patterns,https://www.researchgate.net/publication/277897380_Electricity_Theft_Detection_in_AMI_Using_Customers%27_Consumption_Patterns?_sg=c25SoJoc6n4sywGiMaqhwBPG1rijRcD2Xu6hzBgehuu3g4MCfCSFSjrNZ4etpA3xTXLTNZU0bG2ekMY,"As one of the key components of the smart grid, advanced metering infrastructure brings many potential advantages such as load management and demand response. However, computerizing the metering system also introduces numerous new vectors for energy theft. In this paper, we present a novel consumption pattern-based energy theft detector, which leverages the predictability property of customers' normal and malicious consumption patterns. Using distribution transformer meters, areas with a high probability of energy theft are short listed, and by monitoring abnormalities in consumption patterns, suspicious customers are identified. Application of appropriate classification and clustering techniques, as well as concurrent use of transformer meters and anomaly detectors, make the algorithm robust against nonmalicious changes in usage pattern, and provide a high and adjustable performance with a low-sampling rate. Therefore, the proposed method does not invade customers' privacy. Extensive experiments on a real dataset of 5000 customers show a high performance for the proposed method."
3,PPETD PrivacyPreserving Electricity Theft Detection Scheme with Load Monitoring and Billing for AMI Networks,https://www.researchgate.net/publication/334061879_PPETD_Privacy-Preserving_Electricity_Theft_Detection_Scheme_with_Load_Monitoring_and_Billing_for_AMI_Networks?_sg=0t7J0U24SNDZHMWSxoQYBfwrWSHeVNEBT5UJswi2ToxIBnlA88dDSZcmBfrtIARbuXT1HB4UYeLyHLI,"In advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) networks, smart meters installed at the consumer side should report fine-grained power consumption readings (every few minutes) to the system operator for billing, real-time load monitoring, and energy management. On the other hand, AMI networks are vulnerable to cyber-attacks where malicious consumers report false (low) electricity consumption to reduce their bills in an illegal way. Therefore, it is imperative to develop schemes to accurately identify the consumers that steal electricity by reporting false electricity usage. Most of the existing schemes rely on machine learning for electricity theft detection using the consumers’ fine-grained power consumption meter readings. However, this fine-grained data that is used for electricity theft decetion, load monitoring, and billing can also be misused to infer sensitive information regarding the consumers such as whether they are on travel, the appliances they use, etc. In this paper, we propose an efficient and privacy-preserving electricity theft detection scheme for AMI network and we refer to it as PPETD. Our scheme allows system operators to identify the electricity thefts, monitor the loads, and compute electricity bills efficiently using masked fine-grained meter readings without violating the consumers’ privacy. PPETD uses secret sharing to allow the consumers to send masked readings to the system operator such that these readings can be aggregated for the purpose of monitoring and billing. In addition, secure two-party protocols using arithmetic and binary circuits are executed by the system operator and each consumer to evaluate a generalized convolutionalneural network model on the reported masked fine-grained power consumption readings for the purpose of electricity theft detection. An extensive analysis on real datasets is performed to evaluate the security and the performance of PPETD. Our results confirm that our scheme is accurate in detecting fraudulent consumers with privacy preservation and acceptable communication and computation overhead."

However, such an approach suffers from electricity theft cyberattacks. Different from the existing research that utilizes shallow, static, and customer-specific-based electricity theft de- tectors, this paper proposes a generalized deep recurrent neural network (RNN)-based electricity theft detector that can effectively thwart these cyberattacks. The proposed model exploits the time series nature of the customers' electricity consumption to implement a gated recurrent unit (GRU)-RNN, hence, improving the detection performance. In addition, the proposed RNN-based detector adopts a random search analysis in its learning stage to appropriately fine-tune its hyper-parameters. Extensive test studies are carried out to investigate the detector's performance using publicly available real data of 107,200 energy consumption days from 200 customers. Simulation results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed detector compared with state-of-the-art electricity theft detectors."
